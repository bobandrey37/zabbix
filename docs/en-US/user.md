# Zabbix user configuration

Create a new channel and add the source "Zabbix" in Notify.Events:

![notify-events-token](../../images/notify-events-token.png)

After that, go to Zabbix user settings and add new media. In the "Type" field, select the media-type that you created
and specify the token you get on the previous step in the "Send to" field:

![user](../../images/user.png)

Now you can use Notify.Events to get notifications to the messengers you choose.
